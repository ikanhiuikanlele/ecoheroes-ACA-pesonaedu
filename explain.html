        <h2>About this Website</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            We made this website because we want more kids and teenagers to understand that helping the Earth can be simple, 
            fun, and something anyone can do. Climate change is a serious problem, but many young people feel confused or 
            think their actions are too small to matter. Through this website, we want to show that even small steps, like 
            saving electricity, reducing trash, or learning about the environment, can create a big impact when many people 
            do them together. By exploring missions, growing a virtual seed, reading short articles, and designing a clean 
            version of the Earth, users can learn in a fun and interactive way. Our goal is to inspire young people to start 
            taking small actions every day and realize that protecting the Earth starts with them.

                <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Climate change is the long-term shift in Earth's average weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities 
                    like burning fossil fuels, leading to a rise in global temperatures (global warming), more extreme weather, 
                    melting ice, and rising sea levels, disrupting natural systems. While natural climate shifts occur, the rapid 
                    warming since the 1800s is overwhelmingly caused by human-released greenhouse gases (like CO2 and methane) 
                    trapping heat, creating a warming blanket around the planet.

                <h2>Cause and Effect of Climate Change</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    <b>Causes of Climate Change</b><br><br>
                    Climate change happens because of many actions done by humans. One of the biggest causes is the release of too 
                    much carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere. These gases come from things like cars, factories, 
                    burning coal and oil, and cutting down forests. When trees are removed, there are fewer plants to absorb carbon 
                    dioxide, which makes the problem even worse. <br><br>
                    Using a lot of electricity, wasting energy, and producing large amounts of trash also add to the problem. All 
                    these activities make the Earth trap more heat, which causes the temperature of the planet to rise. <br><br>

                    <b>Effect of Climate Change</b><br><br>
                    Climate change affects the Earth in many ways. The temperature of the planet becomes hotter, which can lead to 
                    stronger heat waves. Weather becomes more extreme, including heavier storms, floods, and droughts. Ice in the 
                    polar regions melts faster, and this causes sea levels to rise. <br><br>
                    Animals and plants also suffer because their homes change too quickly. Some species may struggle to survive. 
                    Climate change can also affect people. It can damage homes, reduce clean water, harm crops, and make some places 
                    unsafe to live in.

                <h2>How to Solve This Problem?</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    We can help solve climate change by taking small actions every day. One way is to use energy wisely, such as 
                    turning off lights when we are not using them and unplugging chargers. We can also reduce waste by reusing items, 
                    recycling, and choosing products that are better for the environment. <br><br>
                    Planting trees and protecting nature are important because trees absorb carbon dioxide and help clean the air. 
                    Using cleaner transportation, like walking, biking, or taking public transport, also helps reduce pollution. <br><br>
                    Saving water, learning more about the environment, and sharing what we know with others can inspire more people 
                    to join in. Even though climate change is a big problem, small steps done by many people can create a big 
                    positive impact for our planet.
