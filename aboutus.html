        <p class="about-subtext">Hello! We are ACA! Abigail, Callista, and Alena. We are the team who built this website, created for the PesonaEdu Young Creators Competition 2025. Our goal is to create something creative and impactful to raise awareness by showing how everyday choices can protect our planet. Through hardwork and dedication, we were able to make a website that's not only educational, but also fun for the younger or even older people.  We hope our project encourages everyone to take small steps that make a big difference. Now, please enjoy exploring our website! </p>
