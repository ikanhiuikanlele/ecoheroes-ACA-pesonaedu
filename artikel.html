        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature, weather patterns, and climate systems on Earth. These changes can include rising global temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns, stronger storms, and longer periods of drought. Climate change affects not only the environment but also human life, animals, and ecosystems around the world.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            One of the main causes of climate change is human activity. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, causing the Earth’s temperature to rise. Deforestation also contributes to climate change because trees absorb carbon dioxide, and cutting them down increases the amount of greenhouse gases in the air.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Climate change has many visible impacts on the planet. Ice caps and glaciers are melting, leading to rising sea levels that threaten coastal areas. Extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires are becoming more frequent and more intense. These changes can damage homes, disrupt food production, and harm wildlife habitats.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Humans are also affected by climate change in serious ways. Changes in climate can lead to food and water shortages, health problems, and the spread of diseases. Communities with fewer resources are often the most vulnerable because they may lack the ability to adapt to extreme weather or environmental changes. Climate change can also cause economic problems and force people to migrate from affected areas.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Although climate change is a global challenge, it can be reduced through collective action. Using renewable energy, reducing waste, saving electricity, protecting forests, and making environmentally friendly choices can help lower greenhouse gas emissions. Governments, organizations, and individuals all play an important role in slowing climate change and protecting the Earth for future generations.
